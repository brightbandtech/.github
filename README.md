## Our mission

Responsibly providing advanced Earth System AI to improve weather and climate-related decisions for the long-term benefit of humanity and the Earth 

## Our approach

- We are building an end-to-end AI Earth System for probabilistic forecasting.
- We will open source benchmark datasets, models, and metrics to establish a common task for global weather forecasting. We hope this will encourage the community to improve the state of the art.
- We will provide tools to academia, government, and companies for AI weather and climate forecasting.
